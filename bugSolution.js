The solution involves correctly configuring Tailwind's JIT mode within your Next.js/Nuxt.js project. This often involves ensuring your framework's build process is aware of and correctly processes the Tailwind directives.  

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
import React from 'react';

const items = ['item1', 'item2', 'item3'];

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map((item, index) => (
        <li key={index} className="bg-blue-500 p-4 rounded">
          {item}
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;

//Additional steps might include:
//1. Ensure you've configured the `tailwind.config.js` file correctly.
//2. Verify that your framework's build process is correctly compiling your CSS.
//3. In Next.js check the `postcss.config.js` to make sure `tailwindcss` and `autoprefixer` are included.
//4. If using Nuxt.js, make sure Tailwind CSS is correctly added and configured in your `nuxt.config.js`.
//5. Consider restarting your development server after making changes to the configuration.
```
This ensures that the Tailwind directives are correctly interpreted and applied to the dynamically generated elements.
