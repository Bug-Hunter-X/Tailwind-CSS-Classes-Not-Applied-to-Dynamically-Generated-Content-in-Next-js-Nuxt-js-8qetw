This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js.  The issue arises when dynamically generated content, particularly lists or arrays, fails to render with Tailwind classes. This happens because Tailwind's JIT mode needs to be configured correctly to process the classes applied to these dynamically generated elements.  Example:

```javascript
//Component.js
const items = ['item1', 'item2', 'item3'];

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map((item, index) => (
        <li key={index} className="bg-blue-500 p-4 rounded">
          {item}
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

In this case, if Tailwind's JIT mode isn't correctly set up in your build process, the `bg-blue-500`, `p-4`, and `rounded` classes might not be applied.
